## Full Feature Description (In-App/Email - Detailed)

### ⚡ Introducing: Bulk Design Changes

Stop wasting time editing items one by one! Our new **Bulk Changes** feature lets you update entire teams or equipment groups instantly.

#### ✨ What's New:

**🎯 Apply to Similar Items Toggle**
- One simple switch in the Design Toolbar
- Automatically detects similar items:
  - All Home team players
  - All Away team players
  - All equipment of the same type (cones, balls, markers, etc.)
- Real-time preview of what will be affected

**🎨 Bulk-Update All Design Properties**
- **Colors**: Change entire team jerseys instantly
- **Sizes**: Resize all players or equipment uniformly
- **Opacity**: Adjust visibility for all similar items
- **Display Options** (for players):
  - Toggle images on/off for all team members
  - Show/hide names across the team
  - Show/hide jersey numbers
  - Show/hide roles/positions

**⚙️ Smart Selection Logic**
- **For Players**: Groups by team (Home/Away/Other)
- **For Equipment**: Groups by type (all Cones, all Balls, etc.)
- Excludes the currently selected item to prevent confusion
- Clear label shows exactly which items will be updated

**🚀 Instant Results**
- Changes apply immediately to all items
- No lag even with 20+ items on the field
- Undo/redo support for safety
- Visual feedback confirms updates

#### 🏆 Use Cases:

**Quick Team Rebranding**
- Change entire team colors in 2 seconds
- Update jersey opacity for formation overlays
- Resize all players for youth/senior team differences

**Equipment Organization**
- Color-code all cones by drill type
- Resize markers for different field zones
- Adjust opacity for background reference items

**Professional Presentations**
- Hide player images for cleaner tactical diagrams
- Show/hide names based on audience
- Uniform sizes for consistent visual hierarchy

**Formation Design**
- Quickly differentiate attacking vs defending players
- Highlight specific team roles with colors
- Create shadow/ghost formations with opacity

#### 📱 How to Use:

**Step 1: Select an Item**
- Tap any player or equipment on the field

**Step 2: Enable Bulk Changes**
- Open Design Toolbar (right sidebar)
- Toggle "Apply to Similar Items" switch ON
- See the label confirming which items will be affected

**Step 3: Make Your Changes**
- Adjust colors, sizes, opacity, or toggles
- Changes instantly apply to ALL similar items!

**Step 4: Toggle OFF When Done**
- Switch back to single-item editing mode
- Continue fine-tuning individual items

#### ⏱️ Time Savings Example:

**Before (Manual):**
- 11 players × 30 seconds each = 5.5 minutes
- Tedious, repetitive work
- Easy to miss items or make inconsistent changes

**After (Bulk Changes):**
- 1 player + toggle ON = 5 seconds
- Consistent across all items
- Error-free updates

**Time Saved: 98%** ⚡
