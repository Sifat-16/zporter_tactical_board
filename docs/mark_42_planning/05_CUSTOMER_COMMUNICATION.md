# MARK 42: Customer Communication Strategy

**Document:** 05 - Managing Expectations & Rollout  
**Last Updated:** November 20, 2025

---

## 🎯 COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES

1. ✅ **Excite customers** about 3D capabilities
2. ✅ **Reassure users** their data is safe
3. ✅ **Manage expectations** (not instant, gradual rollout)
4. ✅ **Gather feedback** early and often
5. ✅ **Minimize churn** during transition

---

## 📢 PHASED COMMUNICATION PLAN

### **Phase 0: Pre-Announcement (Week -2)**

**Goal:** Test messaging with small focus group

**Audience:** 10-20 power users  
**Channel:** Direct email

**Message:**
```
Subject: 🔮 Sneak Peek: The Future of Zporter

Hi [Name],

You're one of our most valued users, and I wanted to share something exciting we're working on.

We're building a **3D tactical view** that will transform how you create and present tactics:

🎥 Watch this 30-second demo: [link to video]

Why 3D?
• More realistic player movements
• Physics-accurate ball trajectories
• Multiple camera angles
• Better for presenting to teams

Your 2D tactics will work exactly as before—this is an *addition*, not a replacement.

Would you be interested in beta testing? Just reply to this email.

Thanks for being part of our journey!

Founder, Zporter Tactical Board
```

**Follow-up Survey:**
- Would 3D help you coach better? (1-5 scale)
- What 3D features matter most?
- Any concerns about the transition?
- Would you beta test for us?

**Success Metric:** 70%+ positive responses → Proceed

## 🛡️ ADDRESSING CONCERNS

### Common User Concerns & Responses

#### **Concern 1: "Will my 2D tactics break?"**

**Response:**
```
Absolutely not! Your 2D tactics are completely safe.

Here's how we protect your work:
✅ 2D data stays untouched
✅ 3D is added *alongside* 2D
✅ You can disable 3D anytime
✅ Worst case: 3D fails → 2D always works

We've tested this with 1,000+ tactics—zero data loss.
```

#### **Concern 2: "Will the app become bloated/slow?"**

**Response:**
```
We're aware of this challenge. Here's our approach:

App Size:
• 2D-only users: No change (+0MB)
• 3D users: +70-90MB (Unity engine)
• Option to uninstall 3D module later

Performance:
• Minimum: iPhone 8 / Samsung Galaxy A52
• Recommended: iPhone 12+ / Samsung S21+
• Low-power mode: Reduced graphics quality

If your device struggles, 2D mode works flawlessly as before.
```

#### **Concern 3: "Do I have to learn new software?"**

**Response:**
```
Nope! If you can use 2D Zporter, you can use 3D.

What's the same:
• All toolbars & buttons
• Same workflow (add players, draw lines, play animation)
• Same save/load system

What's new:
• Camera controls (swipe/pinch—like Google Maps)
• Optional physics tuning (for advanced users)

You'll feel at home in under 5 minutes. Promise! 😊
```

#### **Concern 4: "Will this cost more money?"**

**Response:**
```
Good news: 3D view is FREE for all users!

Free:
✅ 3D field & player models
✅ Basic physics
✅ Camera controls
✅ All existing features

PRO Upgrade (optional):
✨ Advanced trajectory editing
✨ Custom ball spin/curve
✨ Export to video
✨ Cinematic camera angles

Pricing stays the same: $9.99/month or $79.99/year
(Current PRO users: No price increase)
```

#### **Concern 5: "What if I hate it?"**

**Response:**
```
Then don't use it! 😊

3D is 100% optional. You can:
• Stay in 2D forever (no judgment)
• Try 3D once, then disable it
• Toggle back and forth as needed

We'll never force 3D on you. Your choice.
```
